Note: This document is primarily intended for technical personnel to facilitate the assessment of specific development tasks and integration. This page provides an overview of the integration process, detailed interface specifications can be accessed by clicking on the links provided in the document.

## 1. Information Required by the System Integrator for Applying for AppId

* The System Integrator needs to provide the following information:

  * Name of the System Integrator
  * Public Key (Refer to the [appendix](/en/access/appendix?id=_5-how-to-generate-rsa-public-and-private-keys) for generating RSA public-private keys, where rsa_public_key.pem is the generated public key)
  * Backend Callback Notification URL
  * URL for the H5 Front-end Successful Data Retrieval Page ("Result Page"): The page where users automatically navigate upon successful data retrieval
  * URL for the H5 Front-end Data Retrieval Failure Page ("Data List Page"): The page where users automatically navigate upon data retrieval failure
    * These two pages support carrying dynamic parameters not exceeding 12 characters
    * Must be in http/https format
    * URLs should not include a question mark (?), but can include paths and queries
    * If the URL contains a query, do not use status, bizNo, daId, daStatus, site, attach_url as keys
  * Alert Email
  * IP List of Business Testing Backend Servers (i.e., backend services receiving backend callback notifications, used for configuring the whitelist of outbound IP addresses on our firewall)
  * Approximate distribution of daily usage within 24 hours after production environment deployment (used to ensure an adequate number of VDI machines)
  * Whether notification of evidence status (daStatus) changes is required
* The System Integrator should contact the product provider of the clean environment data acquisition platform to apply for appId and appKey, and generate a signature according to the following access instructions.

Please Note:

1. appId and appKey must be kept confidential, where appKey will be sent to the access party separately. Once appKey is leaked, it may result in insecure or unavailable service requests, and the consequences will be borne by the cooperation partner.
2. The appId and appKey for the test environment and production environment are different. When deploying to the production environment, they should be replaced with production environment appId and appKey.
3. The API domain name for the production environment will be provided separately.
4. If using national encryption access, refer to the method of generating [SM2 public-private keys](https://shimo.im/docs/wV3VV8g0voTXj13y#anchor-init) as described in the SM2 public-private key generation appendix.

## 2. Basic Process

![image](./2-1.png)

1. Backend calls the 3.1 [Update AES Encryption Key](/en/access/main?id=_31-update-aes-encryption-key-interface) API to obtain the AES key
   * The AES key needs to be distributed to all other subsystems
2. Call the 3.4 [Send User Agreement to Clean Environment](/en/access/main?id=_34-user-agreement-signing-interface) API, pass the user ID card number, and submit the user agreement
3. Call the 3.3 [start-vdi-x](/en/access/main?id=_33-start-vdi-x-interface-for-accessway-h5sdk) API to obtain the daId and redirectURL for redirecting to the clean environment
   * daId is the unique primary key for all other subsystems to share and verify evidence for a single transaction
4. Use the RSA private key to calculate the signature, append the generated signature to the redirectUrl, and generate the complete URL for accessing the VDI page. Refer to section 3.3.1 for [how to generate the URL to redirect to VDI](/en/access/main?id=_331-how-to-redirect-to-and-load-the-returned-url).
5. Front-end uses this URL to access the clean environment H5 page for evidence collection
6. Users complete evidence collection and click to agree to submit authorization in the open clean environment
7. Front-end can automatically redirect from the clean environment H5 to the pre-provided result page, carrying bizNo, daId, daStatus, and site during redirection. When data retrieval is successful, the daStatus in the front-end callback is 5 (downloading) or 10 (download completed terminal state). When data retrieval fails, the daStatus in the front-end callback is a failure state.
8. Backend receives the user evidence collection status notification from the clean environment, refer to [chapter](/en/access/main?id=_4-notification-v2-format-interface-description-for-system-integrators)for notification reception instructions.
9. Backend downloads the original evidence file, refer to section 4.4 [Downloading files](/en/access/main?id=_44-downloading-files) for return value download instances.
10. Similarly, the backend receives the clean environment's notification of storage certificate generation and downloads the storage certificate.

## 3. [Front-end Redirection] Notice for Configuring "Data Retrieval Successful Result Page" and "Data Retrieval Failure Data Source Page" in App's H5

The concept of success page and result page is triggered by the completion of data retrieval:

* If the user successfully completes the data retrieval, they will enter the configured data retrieval success result page.
* If the user times out or the data retrieval fails (e.g., non-owner login), they will enter the configured data retrieval failure data source page.

The front-end callback redirection in these two ways is a hard redirection via window.location.replace, carrying bizNo, daId, daStatus, site in query form, and may have attach_url and status.

* bizNo, site: passed in by arg.bizNo and arg.site when calling start-vdi-x
* attach_url: passed in by arg.ext.urlattach when calling start-vdi-x
* daId, daStatus: daId and daStatus for the current data retrieval
  * When data retrieval is successful, the daStatus in the front-end callback is 0 (in progress), 5 (downloading), or 10 (download completed terminal state). When data retrieval fails, the daStatus in the front-end callback is a failure state (>10) or -60000 (general failure).
  * Example result URL:

```
https://www.yyy.com/jumpChannel.html?attach_url=channel_a&bizNo=acf1700443444e7b9206c6d5b36ec955&daId=zd240e1e1722158295759228928&site=app-tax-income&daStatus=10
```

If your call is in-app through H5 integration and configuration, please note:

- We **CANNOT** close our own H5 page or webview container.
- If users trigger a "cancel" popup through some means and click "confirm exit", it is actually a redirect through history.go(-1), which will redirect to the previous page of the data retrieval process, retaining the browsing history but without carrying any business fields.
- If users directly close your entire app, because the entire webview is closed, no front-end return business fields will be received.
- Due to different apps may use multi-process/thread mode, it cannot be guaranteed that after the redirect, the webview will be completely closed after window.location.replace redirection.

**Best practice**:
Configure a transit page as a unified success/failure page entrance point, and on this page, decide how to redirect to the actual business page based on the information such as bizNo and daStatus, and close the clean environment page.

**Fallback Logic**:
Regardless of whether it's a configured success page or a failure page, it's recommended to actively destroy the page, activity, or webview of the clean environment on this page. This ensures consistent forward and backward logic and prevents any residual webviews.

**Fallback Logic 2**:
If your app has a back button, make sure to confirm its implementation logic. It should not trigger a return to the clean environment page. If this situation occurs, remember to destroy the relevant pages, activities, or webviews of the clean environment.

**Fallback Logic 3**:
If there is no way to destroy the clean environment page, you can forcefully redirect to the correct business page on the intermediate page to reduce the risk of users forcibly returning to the clean environment page.
