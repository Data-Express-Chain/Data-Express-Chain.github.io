## Overview

Nowadays, it is difficult for individual users to effectively ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of their provided data. To address this issue, we developed Data Express Chain, focusing on the portability of personal data in Fintech area. Users proactively and independently initiate personal data transfer process, including fetching and authorizing data to third party all by themselves. Afterwards, Data Express Chain incorporates blockchain technology to realize trustworthy and tamper-proof data verification. This process ensures the authenticity and reliability of data transfer among multiple organizations, and it aims to build a basic infrastructure for secure and trusted personal data exchange.
