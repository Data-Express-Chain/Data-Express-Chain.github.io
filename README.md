## Introduction

Nowadays, it is difficult for individual users to effectively ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of their provided data. To address this issue, we have developed a SaaS service (Data Express Chain). The project is focusing on the portability of personal data in Fintech area. In the beginning, users proactively initiate personal data transmission by uploading the data by themselves. Afterwards, Data Express Chain incorporates blockchain technology to realize trustworthy data verification and further ensure the authenticity and reliability of data. This process allows users to become key participants in the process of data exchange - and it further grants the rights of personal data information to single individuals, aiming to build a basic infrastructure for cross-industry, cross-scenario, and distributed data transmission.
